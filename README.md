The loading screen in this repository is programmed with HTML y CSS. HTML is used to structure the page and CSS is used to style and animate it. Some of the techniques used include:

- Using relative measurements to make the screen adapt to different screen sizes.
- Using flexbox to flexibly align elements on screen.
- Creating an animation with CSS to bring the loading screen to life.
